# TF-IDF
Tf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency.
The tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining.
This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.
